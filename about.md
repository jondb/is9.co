  Hey there! This site is a dumping ground of things that might help others. Enjoy.
</p>

I'm an information security consultant in San Francisco with over 15 years of experience. In the past, I've worked for large organizations like Goolge, EY, Wells Fargo, and Kaiser Permanente. 

Today I help startups build information security right from the start with the right culture, secure processes, and architect secure code and infrastructure.

When I'm not working, I am raising my four amazing kids with my beautiful wife.
